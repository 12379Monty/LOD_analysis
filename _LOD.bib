	abstract = {Linear calibrated chemical measurements are based on the assumption of linearity. Due to influences of matrices at real samples the condition of linearity can be violated. Therefore, a profound examination has to attach much importance on the linearity of calibration. However, different procedures have been applied for this purpose in literature. In order to examine linear calibration for non-linearity, a recently presented procedure is compared with conventional techniques. The associated statistical models and estimations are represented. The applicability of the different procedures is demonstrated in some practical examples, the determination of arsenic in surface water samples taken from different sites in abandoned mining areas in central Germany. Recommendations for using the indicators and tests of non-linearity are given.},

	abstract = {Quantitative measures of the nonlinearity of an analytical method are defined as follows: the "(dimensional) nonlinearity" of a method is the square root of the mean of the square of the deviation of the response curve from a straight line, where the straight line is chosen to minimize the nonlinearity. The "relative nonlinearity" is defined as the dimensional nonlinearity divided by the difference between the maximum and minimum assayed values. These definitions may be used to develop practical criteria for linearity that are still objective. Calculation of the nonlinearity requires a method of curve-fitting. In this article, we use polynomial regression to demonstrate calculations, but the definition of nonlinearity also accommodates alternative nonlinear regression procedures.},

@article{Goldsack:2020vg,
	abstract = {Digital medicine is an interdisciplinary field, drawing together stakeholders with expertize in engineering, manufacturing, clinical science, data science, biostatistics, regulatory science, ethics, patient advocacy, and healthcare policy, to name a few. Although this diversity is undoubtedly valuable, it can lead to confusion regarding terminology and best practices. There are many instances, as we detail in this paper, where a single term is used by different groups to mean different things, as well as cases where multiple terms are used to describe essentially the same concept. Our intent is to clarify core terminology and best practices for the evaluation of Biometric Monitoring Technologies (BioMeTs), without unnecessarily introducing new terms. We focus on the evaluation of BioMeTs as fit-for-purpose for use in clinical trials. However, our intent is for this framework to be instructional to all users of digital measurement tools, regardless of setting or intended use. We propose and describe a three-component framework intended to provide a foundational evaluation framework for BioMeTs. This framework includes (1) verification, (2) analytical validation, and (3) clinical validation. We aim for this common vocabulary to enable more effective communication and collaboration, generate a common and meaningful evidence base for BioMeTs, and improve the accessibility of the digital medicine field.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In Korea, the Korean Laboratory Accreditation Program (KLAP) has set minimum standards for verification of clinical test performance. This verification process is time-consuming and labor-intensive when performed manually. We developed a free, statistical software program for KLAP, using the R language (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). METHODS: We used CLSI guidelines for the algorithm. We built graphic user interfaces, including data input, with Embarcadero Delphi EX4 (Embarcadero Technologies, Inc., Texas, USA). The R Base Package and MCR Package for Method Comparison Regression were used to implement statistical and graphical procedures. RESULTS: Our program LaboStats has six modules: parallel test, linearity, method comparison, precision, reference interval, and cutoff. Data can be entered into the field either manually or by copying and pasting from an MS Excel worksheet. Users can print out precise reports. CONCLUSIONS: LaboStats can be useful for evaluating clinical test performance characteristics and preparing documents requested by KLAP.},

	abstract = {The measure of linearity is an important part of the evaluation of a method. According to the NCCLS guidelines (Document EP6-P), results of a linearity experiment are fit to a straight line and judged linear either by visual evaluation, which is subjective, or by the lack-of-fit test. This approach depends on the precision of the method, is not necessarily conclusive, and fails to be quantitative. We define linearity as a measure of how well a first-order (linear) polynomial fits the data compared with a higher-order (nonlinear) polynomial. The major property of a linear polynomial is that the first derivative is a constant. The nonlinearity of a method can be measured by the difference between these two polynomials (first-order and higher-order) at specific values or, as an average, the root-mean difference. This approach is independent of the precision of the assay and is conclusive, quantitative, and objective.},

One is often called upon to limit the reportable range in order to find the linear region. Limiting the reportable range by visual techniques is subjective, may introduce bias and is not programmable. Using Kroll and Emancipator's polynomial method for linearity, we compare the residuals of a test to determine whether eliminating a point from one end or the other of the data set worsens or improves the data sets' linearity. In an example of urinary cortisol, the root mean squares of the residuals improve by 2% when the lowest point is removed, 39% when the highest point is removed and 82% when the two highest points are removed. The latter data set is the most linear.},

@article{Kroll:2000vm,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To extend the polynomial method for evaluating linearity in 2 ways. First, we developed a screen to ascertain whether the data were precise enough to permit a reliable evaluation of linearity and therefore eliminate findings of linearity due to low statistical power. Second, we assessed whether the degree of nonlinearity detected by the polynomial method was clinically relevant using a statistically rigorous method. METHODS: Because we assessed linearity relative to a clinically determined level of importance instead of the default value of zero, we used sampling theory based on the noncentral chi(2) distribution. Using statistical power calculations, we incorporated a screen for imprecision that guarantees that the probability of correctly identifying nonlinear methods is at least 80%. RESULTS: With the described methods, we achieved a sensitivity of at least 80% and a specificity of at least 95%. When the data were too imprecise to achieve a sensitivity of 80%, no determination of linearity was made. This procedure mimics the practice in manual inspection of flagging data that appear imprecise by visual inspection and halting the evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: Formal statistical tests for precision and amount of nonlinearity are advantageous because they allow us to quantify and limit classification errors. By formalizing these various aspects of linearity assessment, we maintain some of the complex features of manual methods while making the linearity assessment feasible to apply to a high volume of assessments and removing the between-analyst variability.},

@article{Krouwer:1993tu,
	abstract = {We present a statistical method to quantify deviations from linearity for assays that veer from linear assay responses. Our procedure handles the common case of unequally spaced analyte levels and nonconstant variance and provides a least-squares estimate with a confidence interval for the amount of deviation from assay linearity at a specified analyte concentration. This estimate of assay bias due to nonlinearity goes beyond the NCCLS EP6 lack-of-fit test, which tests for only the presence of nonlinearity. Knowing that nonlinearity is present is insufficient; users need to know the magnitude of the bias caused by nonlinearity. Our method can also be used with multifactor designs that estimate other systematic assay effects such as drift and carryover, thus obviating the need for a separate protocol to assess linearity. The procedure is carried out by adding extra columns to the design matrix corresponding to the concentration level(s) of interest. The extra columns, which replace the quadratic column, are orthogonal to all other columns. We describe a general method of constructing the new columns, and illustrate the procedure with a manual ammonia assay example dataset from EP6.},

	abstract = {Background: According to recent International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards, the limit of detection (LoD) of an assay should be estimated taking both type I (α) and II (β) errors into account. The suggested procedure, however, supposes gaussian distributions of both blank and sample measurements and a linear calibration curve. In clinical chemistry, asymmetric, nongaussian blank distributions are common, and the calibration curve may be nonlinear. We present a partly nonparametric procedure that takes these aspects into account.Methods: Using theoretical distribution models and simulation studies, we developed a LoD estimation procedure suitable for the field of clinical chemistry that is partly based on nonparametric statistics.Results: For sample size n, the nonparametrically determined 95th percentile of the blank measurements {\{}obtained as the value of the {$[$}n(95/100) + 0.5{$]$}th ordered observation{\}} defines the limit for results significantly exceeding zero {$[$}limit of blank (LoB){$]$}. The LoD is the lowest value that is likely to yield a result exceeding the LoB. LoD is estimated as: LoB + cβ×SDS, where SDS is the analytical SD of a sample with a low concentration; cβ= z1 −β/{$[$}1 −1/(4 ×f){$]$}; z1 −βis the standard normal deviate; and f is the number of degrees of freedom for estimation of SDS. cβis approximately equal to 1.65 for a type II error of 5{\%}. Approaches and needed tabular values for calculation of confidence limits are presented as well as sample size. Worked examples are given to illustrate estimation and verification of the limit of detection. Simulation results are used to document performance.Conclusion: The proposed procedure appears useful for application in the field of clinical chemistry and promotes a standardized approach for estimating LoDs of clinical chemistry assays.},

	abstract = {{$[$}We consider the following linear calibration problem. Two scalar quantities X and Y are related by a simple linear regression of Y on X, and at the calibration step repeated measurements on both X and Y are available for a number of sampling units. At the prediction step a Y measurement, possibly together with previously obtained Y measurements, is available for a new sampling unit, and we wish to estimate the corresponding unknown X. Both the intercept and the slope of the regression are allowed to vary between units, resulting in a random regression coefficient model at the calibration step. As a result, at the prediction step the unknown X affects both the mean and covariance structure of Y. Point and interval estimates for X are obtained and illustrated on a set of biomedical data.{$]$}},

Maximum likelihood estimates don't behave well when outliers or inluential observations are present. One remedy is to remove inluential observations from the data and then apply the maximum likelihood technique on the deleted data. Another approach is to employ a robust technique that can handle outliers and inluential observations without removing any observations from the data sets. The robustness of the method is tested using real and simulated data sets.},

@article{Tholen:1992uz,
	abstract = {With the increase in demand for linearity assessment, a wide variety of analysis techniques have been advocated. There is no consensus on optimal techniques. This article reviews different approaches that have been advocated by the College of American Pathologists, by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards, and by manufacturers of diagnostic methods and controls. This is not a review of all statistical techniques proposed for linearity assessment. I discuss four basic categories of methods, with the first and simplest being visual review. The second general approach includes the conventional statistical techniques based on least-squares regression; this includes an equation for the line and statistical tests for linearity and for curvature. The third general approach involves comparison of slopes for line segments, or "deltas." This approximates the visual assessment of linearity. The fourth approach involves comparing observed and expected values, with some allowance for differences. Comparisons can be made for observed single results, means of replicates, or components of variance. Allowances for error can be internal goals or goals that are recommended for clinical usefulness. Each approach has strengths in different aspects of linearity assessment, including intuitive appeal, statistical rigor, and objectivity. Similarly, each approach has limitations that are not always obvious.},

	n2 = {Abstract Experimenters in toxicology often compare the concentration-response relationship between two distinct populations using the median lethal concentration (LC50). This comparison is sometimes done by calculating the 95{\%} confidence interval for the LC50 for each population, concluding that no significant difference exists if the two confidence intervals overlap. A more appropriate test compares the ratio of the LC50s to 1 or the log(LC50 ratio) to 0. In this ratio test, we conclude that no difference exists in LC50s if the confidence interval for the ratio of the LC50s contains 1 or the confidence interval for the log(LC50 ratio) contains 0. A Monte Carlo simulation study was conducted to compare the confidence interval overlap test to the ratio test. The confidence interval overlap test performs substantially below the nominal α= 0.05 level, closer to p = 0.005; therefore, it has considerably less power for detecting true differences compared to the ratio test. The ratio-based method exhibited better type I error rates and superior power properties in comparison to the confidence interval overlap test. Thus, a ratio-based statistical procedure is preferred to using simple overlap of two independently derived confidence intervals.},
